**Work Plan/Assignments**

* Lauren typed up the work plan
* We all do "Becoming a Data Scientist" 
* We will work on each project (B, C) together for maximum collaboration.

**Completion Timeline**

* We will all do the "Becoming a data scientist" assignment individually whenever works for us and expect that we will submit it before the deadline.

* We will work on the Galton data assignment together in class 3/29 and 3/31. 

* Lastly, we will work on the streaming data assignment in class 3/31 if there is time and also on 4/5. If we do not complete the project in class we will plan to meet sometime before the project is due.


**Communication Plan**

* We will be communicating via text group chat or email.
